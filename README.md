A work in progress (Pre-Alpha):

This is an iOS version of RenewPass for Android by Coffeeboys (https://github.com/Coffeeboys/RenewPass)

The vision:

RenewPass does the work of renewing your UPass for you. Enter your school credentials, and RenewPass will log in to your UPassBC account and request the latest available UPass, all with a single tap.

Your school credentials are stored locally on your phone, and your password is encrypted before being saved, so only RenewPass can see it.

Currently supported schools (checking only, not renewing):
- SFU (Pre-Alpha)
